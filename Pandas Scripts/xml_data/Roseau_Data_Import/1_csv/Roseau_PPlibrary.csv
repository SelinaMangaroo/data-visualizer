The cover is a commemorative poster that celebrates one hundred years of county history by depicting the ""Medora"" loaded with passengers, mail, and supplies on its daily run from Pelan to Roseau, Minnesota soon after the county was organized. The horse-drawn coach followed the sand ridge traveled by various Indian tribes as well as the trappers and hunters in the area. 

Marv Espe designed this cover. Marv Espe grew up on a farm near Roseau, Minnesota and has enjoyed producing works of art which reflect his rural background as well as his love of natural subjects which include woods and water as well as the creatures that live there. His art career began in 1965 after a brief five-year stint as an elementary teacher. His formal art training included time at the American Academy of Art in Chicago as well as at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

From 1965 until 1977 he was employed by Jostens Inc. of Owatonna, Minnesota as staff artist in their Graphic Arts Division. In 1977, Espe with his wife Myrna and two children moved to northern Minnesota where for 20 years he was engaged in painting a wide range of local subjects as well as illustrating for numerous publishers on a free-lance basis.

In 1997 he and his wife moved to northern Wisconsin where he continues to create beautiful art. To date he has produced and sold well more than 1100 original paintings. Well over 1000 of his illustrations have also been published over the years. He has also conducted painting workshops for numerous art organizations in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and Nebraska.

His paintings have been included in many group and individual exhibitions throughout the upper midwest, and are seen in private as well as corporate collections throughout the U.S. and Canada.

National organizations that have used his art include: The Artists Magazine, The American Artist Magazine, National Arbor Day Foundation, National Wildlife Federation, National Rifle Association and others.  http://marvespeart.com/about/

by Michael Meuers

Stillday was a well-known spiritual leader, healer and teacher from Red Lake Nation who touched many Ojibwe people in northern Minnesota. His words and teachings not only impacted the Native population, but people from all walks of life. He inspired thousands with his teachings about living in harmony, not only with each other, but also with nature. He passed on in May 2014, but his message survives. 
Meuers was given a spirit name by Stillday (Biidaanakwad Izhinikaazo - Gathering Cloud is His Name). He has worked in public relations for the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians for more than twenty years, and during this time he spearheaded the Ojibwe Language project in Bemidji, MN, which was recently recognized by National Geographic for: ... support in sustaining and enhancing the unique geographic character of the region... 
Having just finished reading, I am proud to call you my brother and found it to be absolutely awesome, heart-warming, informative, and touches ones heart in a very special way. ~Eugene Bugger McArthur, former Chairman of White Earth Nation 
https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33636390-road-to-ponemah

Meuers lives with his wife, three cats, and a dog on a four-acre peninsula overlooking the Mississippi River just after it leaves Lake Bemidji. They have two adult daughters and two Grandchildren. He grew up in the Twin Cities moving to Minnesota's Great North Woods in his early 30's. He first lived near Northome, MN where he built a house having more time than money. A few years later he had the house moved 55 miles to it's current location on the Mississippi River near Bemidji, MN.

He worked for a local public television afiliate before taking a job with the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians. He has worked as a public relations person with the Band for 22 years taking photos and writing storiesabout the Red Lake Band.

He has worked in a varity of ways to help bridge Indian and Non-Indian culture of north central Minnesota, by encouraging learning, the celebration of diversity, and to open a dialog that would begin this conversation.

He spearheaded Bemidji's Ojibwe Language Project. Nearly 200 businesses and organizations withing a hundred miles of Bemidji post a variety of common signage in both English and Ojibwe through his efforts.

meuers recieved a Spirit (Indian) name in a ceremony conducted by the book's subject, Larry Stillday, in the summer of 2013. Biidaanakwad Izhinikaazo. (Gathering Cloud is His Name).

Meuers operates a blog, titled: Indian Country, Through the Eyes of an Irishman. You can find it here: http://omakakii.blogspot.com/

Snowshoes, birchbark canoes, wild rice, and beaver pelts. Two hundred years ago, beaver pelts were the common denominator that brought two cultures together, creating an uncommonly successful business and opening the North American continent.
In the late 1700s, the North West Company was the biggest enterprise in North America, and fur trading was its business. Furs harvested by the Indians across the continent and transported in birchbark canoes to wilderness trading posts ended up on the sleeves and hems of French princesses and Chinese emperors. Felt hats on the heads of European businessmen and military officers began as beaver pelts that were paddled through a maze of rivers and then shopped by sail to Europe. Iron tools, woolen blankets, and calico cloth manufactured in England found their way to the lodges and wigwams of Indians across North America.
The fur trade began only a few decades after Christopher Columbus first sailed west from Europe, and it continues for over three centuries. Drawing on episodes from the diaries of explorers and traders and a lifetime of experience living in the heart of what once was fur country, the author has brought to life a pivotal chapter of American history that is seldom examined. She also worked closely with experts in the field and gathered archival prints, paintings and maps in order to put faces on the many people and places involved in the fur trade's rich history",,1492,,,0,,,,,,,,,8: Communication Artifact,"Research Rm, Bookcase 1 Sh-3",1,,,,,,0.00,,,978-1-59078-426-6,,English,0.000000,1960,,,,,,0,,,,,,,0.000000,Never,2022-01-21,,,2022.5.1,Book,,,,,,Documentary Artifact,"Roseau County Historical Society

It tells of explorers who passed that way in search of the Western Sea or of routes to the Arctic; of settlers who traveled the river on their way to new homes in the West; of prospectors seeking gold; and of artists recording the face of the country in the sketchbooks.

This book was written in 1852 and first published in 1885, is perhaps the most important history of the Ojibway (Chippewa) People ever written. Warren, the son of an Ojibway woman and a white man, collected firsthand descriptions and stories from his relatives, tribal leaders, and aquaintances. He transcribed this oral history in terms that nineteenth-century whites could understand, focusing on warfare, tribal organization, and political leaders. Interspersed among his vivid descriptions of memorable battles is a wealth of information on the Ojibway people's customs, family life, totemic system, hunting methods, fur trade, and relations with other tribal groups and with whites.

True stories of the real Norwegian - and Danish - bachelor farmers and their cousins, aunts, uncles, grandparents and neighbors.
'""A Boy From Wannaska"" shines light on a northern Minnesota farming community, where first-generation Scandinavian immigrants built new lives early in the twentieth century. This memoir describes farming and household practices, and tells hilarious stories of backwoods farmers in a new enviroment: learning to drive, hunting moose, building new social institutions - and competitive potlucks at a local Lutheran Church, made of 37 souls and 7 Danes.
Marjorie Wright Mortensen collected this heritage of tales told among the children and grandchildren of Scandinavian immigrants in Roseau County.

This is a story containing all the elements calculated to hold the attention and fire the imagination of any boy. For where is the boy that is not intrigued by thoughts of canoeing on uncharted streams and hidden lakes, of making portages, of nights on the lake shores under the stars made mysterious by the cry of the loon, of strange characters in the deep woods, of Indians, and of strange tales about ""heavy water"" possibly betraying the whereabouts of precious uranium. All of that is here within this book. Mr. Chapin has chosen as the setting for his story a background he knows so well from having lived in it---northern Minnesota and southern Manitoba which is commonly called Lake of the Woods country----and to point out that the greatest treasures men may find are not material, he has incorporated into his story a factual account of the earliest pages of the history of Lake of the Woods.
