From Currie Independent December 1908:
The Nickel Plate Restaurant has advanced in popularity under the able and intelligent management of Mr. F. T. Winkler and his family. Besides giving meals and lunches all day and evening, they have also rooms to accommodate a limeted number and they keep for sale oysters, bread crackers, fruit, candies, etc.  They have built up a good trade and we predict for them a bright future.

The Currie Independent October 1915:
Mr. Arthur Lloyd purchased the Nickel Plate restaurant last year and has built up an excellent trade in this line.  He handles a complete lind of candies, fruits and vegetables and is open at all hours to the public.  He makes a specialty of quick lunches and has many who enjoy teh table board.  Mr. Lloyd keeps a clean and respectable place and invites your patronage.

Note on Back:
The above cut of the Old Log Cabin at Lake Shetek is reproduced from the original negative owned and copyrighted by Miss Mame Starr, of this place and is publised by courtesy of the owner.  The negative was taken several years ago and is the only perfect reproduction of the cabin as it stood at the time of the famous outbreak of 1862.  Photographs of this negative are for sale by Miss Starr who is this year mounting the prints both in plain photograph form and also on glass in the form of small medallions.  The picture possesses historic value as well as being a thing of beauty in itself and is meeting with ready sale.
